## Background

This repository contains the design and implementation of a shiny app to assist cancer registers in conducting rapid descriptive and predictive analytics in a user-friendly, intuitive, portable and scalable way. We want to describe the design and implementation roadmap to inspire other population registers to exploit their datasets and develop similar tools and models.

## This repository

This repository contains all the code, scripts and services, such as the front-end and back-end, to deploy the cancer web platform.

* CancerRegistry-WebPlatform: This folder contains the scripts to deploy the API and the RShiny service (front-end views). The API was implemented by NodeJS. The RShiny platform is based on the R language.

* CancerRegistryDatabase: This folder contains the scripts to create and deploy the database. It is a non-relational database based on MongoDB. This directory also includes a script to import the data from a CSV file.
